TEXT CHANGE FOR THE BOXES (yellow slide)

 INCREASED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY AND HEALTH - Social distancing could lead to a sedentary lifestyle. Signing your children up for a physical activity will help them develop good health habits.
 
 SOCIAL AND COMMUNITY BONDS HELP BUILD TEAM SPIRIT AND VICE VERSA -    Participating in sports as part of a team can give your children a chance to get to know and build stronger connections
 
 IMPROVE ACADEMIC POTENTIAL -    Young people who pursue sports are more likely to have a strong self-concept and are very goal driven
 LEARN HOW TO FACE AND OVERCOME CHALLENGES -   Youth playing sport are more likely to adapt to change, face adversity and can learn to make quick decisions as well as work as a team.
 
 BUILD A FOUNDATION FOR LIFELONG DISCIPLINE AND HEALTH -    Participating in sports can help young people develop healthy habits that last a lifetime. They learn that regular practice can help them gain new skills and can bring higher levels of performance.
 
 SPORT & THE SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS -    Sport creates a noticeable impact and is also an important enabler of sustainable development.
 GIRLS IN SPORT -    Starting and running a quality girls’ sport program with passion and commitment may be challenging, but will result in raising strong, powerful and successful women.
 
 EMPOWERING YOUTH -    Sports are opportunities for youth to learn; they provide a “practice field" for life. Empowering youth through sport helps them to go into their communities and become ambassadors of sport and change makers.
